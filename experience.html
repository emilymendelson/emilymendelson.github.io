            <h3>Entrepreneurship Internship | <a href="https://www.queensu.ca/innovationcentre/spread-innovation-challenge">Spread Innovation Challenge</a></h3><p>
                The Queen's Innovation Centre Summer Initiative is a 16-week program providing 
                students with the training, mentorship, and resources to successfully launch their own business ventures.
                My team is focused on developing a website connecting senior citizens with grocery volunteers during the 
                COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

                <h3>Research Assistant | Evolutionary Genetics</h3><p>
                    I developed verbal and written communication skills by collaborating on a team of researchers, 
                    discussing recent research and scientific literature, and documenting findings in reports and data records.
                    I was responsible for the planning, preparation, and performance of laboratory assays. I also gained experience with 
                    data input, analysis, and visualization using Microsoft Excel.

                <h3>Data Analyst Internship | Assessment Standards and Mass Appraisal</h3><p>
                    As a data analyst, I used analytical skills to independently design a method of accurately grouping Toronto condo 
                    parking units using SPSS syntax and Microsoft Excel. I extracted data from internal corporate databases,
                    assisted with the input and verification of property assessment data, and ensured data accuracy in internal databases.

                    As a statistics tutor taught 14 undergraduate students over the course of 3 semesters, with an average improvement 
                    in grades by 10%. I taught the basics of R, ANOVA-tests, linear regression analysis, chi-square tests, t-tests, 
                    F-tests, hypothesis testing, and sampling distributions.

                <h3>Unit Supervisor and Team Lead</h3><p>
                    At Canada's Wonderland I was promoted to Team Lead within first 3 months and the following season I was promoted to unit supervisor.
                    I was responsible for achieving unit financial goals by reducing annual labour costs, proper budgeting, scheduling and management 
                    of inventory, allowing for revenues of up to $20,000 per day. I also facilitated in training sessions and delegated tasks to over 
                    50 staff members to promote an efficient and motivated team. I was able to develop time management skills and the ability to 
                    prioritize tasks while working in a fast-paced environment.

                <h3>Stadium Usher | Rogers Center</h3><p>
                    I used initiative and interpersonal skills to collaborate on an interdisciplinary team to proactively identify risks to 
                    staff and guests. I also assessed the adequacy of controls to manage such risks, including recommending enhanced or 
                    additional controls. I also wrote legal documentation of any safety incidents or concerns. I responded to inquiries 
                    from the public using customer service, 
                    verbal communication, and active listening skills.
